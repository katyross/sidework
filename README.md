### Overview
        Tracking one's bi-weekly income is sometimes complicated and often laborious for tipped employees in the food and beverage industry, 
    this lack of foresight towards the size of one's bi-weekly paycheck often means budgeting is left until the last minute, 
    or just dismissed for lack of ease in tracking incoming funds. Although there are already applications in the 
    market for monthly budgeting, calculating debt repayments, and tracking server income, I hope to make the  
    budgeting process more cohesive, why use 3-4 apps when you could use one? 
        In an effort to promote healthier financial habits for service industry workers, I aspire to create a web application that allows users to track 
    incoming tips and hourly wages, track deductions such as tip out and tax withholding, budget with one's estimated
    bi-weekly income, and demonstrate one's ability to pay extra towards debts to lower the lifetime of one's loans. I was inspired to 
    create this app by personal frustrations from tip tracking apps not having tax estimators and trying to utilize Ramsey solution 
    apps for debt snowball calculations and budgeting, I felt their applications overlooked those with variable incomes and made zero
    based budgeting and financial planning difficult.
